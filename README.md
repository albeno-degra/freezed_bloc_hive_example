## About
A demo Flutter project showcasing best practices for using **Freezed**, **Bloc/Cubit**, **Hive**, and **Clean Architecture** principles.

### Technologies
- **Freezed** — immutable data classes, sealed unions, pattern matching (, , )
- **Bloc/Cubit** — robust state management with clear separation of UI and business logic
- **Hive** — lightweight, fast, and type-safe local storage
- **Clean Architecture** — organized code into layers (presentation, domain, data) for maintainability and testability

### Features
- Theme management: toggle between light and dark modes, persist theme in Hive, reactive UI updates via Cubit
- Freezed + Hive integration, including storing enums and custom adapters
- Cubit with multiple states and UI reaction via maybeWhen/when
- Easily extendable structure following clean architecture principles

### Purpose
Intended for learning and as a reference example for Flutter developers who want to see a practical combination of Freezed, Bloc, Hive, and Clean Architecture.
